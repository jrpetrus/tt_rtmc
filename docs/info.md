## Introduction

The Real Time Motor Controller (RTMC) is designed to control a stepper motor such as the SEQ_28BYJ_48. The step_table
is programmed with the coil positions for the motor, and each step advances the table_idx to the next coil position.
The size of the step is programmable via step_size. The step_size may be positive or negative. The example motor
supports step_size in [-2, -1, 1, 2]. The table_last set the limit for the table_idx before resetting to 0. It would
be set to 7 for the example motor if abs(step_size) == 1 or 6 if abs(step_size) == 2.

The step control increments the table_idx + step_size. The run control continously increments table_idx, with a
pause of step_delay cycles between increments.

## SPI Peripheral Protocol

Control of the RTMC is accomplished via its SPI peripheral interface and simple read/write protocol.

SPI must be byte-oriented and send most significant bit first.

SPI mode must be CPOL=0, CPHA=0.

1-byte OPCODE: NOP=0, RD=1, WR=2.

1-byte ADDRESS: Select the register

2-byte DATA: Transfer in two bytes, MSB first.

1-byte RESULT: BUSY=0, ACK=1, ACK_DATA=2

The SPI peripheral _should_ operate at up to 1/2 the core clock frequency. My target is 50 MHz core and 25 MHz SCK.

### Write Operation

Tx: WR, ADDR, DATA0, DATA1

Rx: Loop reading 1-byte RESULT until ACK seen.

### Read Operation

Tx: RD, ADDR

Rx: Loop reading 1-byte RESULT until ACK_DATA seen.

Rx: DATA0, DATA1

## How to test

Connect up the external hardware, program the registers, and write a 1 to the run bit.
MicroPython code in the works, but not until the chips come back.

## External hardware

Assuming use of the TT Demo board.

Utilize the RP2040 SPI0 in controller mode to communicate with the RTMC.

Connect uio[3:0] to a SEQ_28BYJ_48 motor + ULN2003 Driver.

uio[7:4] could optionally be connected to a second motor driven in tandem.
